👋 Hi, I’m Paula Gambús i Moreno.

👀 I'm passionate about Biomedical Engineering, especially Computer Science and the potential of AI in medicine.

🌱 I studied Biomedical Engineering at Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona, and currently pursuing a Master's in Human-Centered AI at DTU.

💼 I have a 10-month internship experience as a software developer and tester at ABLE Human Motion, where I focused on ABLE exoskeleton software development and verification using Dart and Flutter.

🎓 My Bachelor's Thesis involved creating a Python algorithm (Pytorch with MONAI library) to segment spinal cord lesions in Multiple Sclerosis patients from DIR sequences in collaboration with La Vall d'Hebron's neuroradiology department.

💞️ I'm seeking opportunities to collaborate with technical and clinical researchers and contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a team.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me! Looking forward to connecting and learning more about you.
